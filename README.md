This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving undefined behavior when manipulating vectors using raw pointers. The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected and safer approach.  The issue arises from modifying a vector's contents via a raw pointer after the vector's length or capacity might have been changed, leading to memory safety violations.
